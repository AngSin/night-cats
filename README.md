# Game
NightCats is a collection of 3,330 Normal cat and 1 God cat NFTs. A God cat has the ability to kill the normal cats if
they are listed under 1e on OpenSea.

Owning a NightCat gives you the right to mint Necklaces for these cats. These necklaces give the cats the ability to be
immune to the God Cat's curse, to resurrect a dead cat and to challenge the God cat for its "God" status.
